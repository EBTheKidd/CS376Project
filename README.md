### Finished Stuff
1. Sockets - Data is successfully transfered between Server & Client(s)
2. Logger - Desired information is sent to Console & Program UI for user display (also saved to log.txt)
3. Threadding - Programs are threadded to ensure optimal performance (still needs tweaking/improving)
4. UI implementation - MetroFrameworkUI is used to skin the application so it looks more appealing

### ToDo
1. Ensure DDOS functionality is working correctly (possibly change attack implementation)
2. Ensure multiple client connections will work simultaneously
3. Improve Performance/Efficiency
4. Implement User Settings functionality (xml file that saves/loads on launch/exit)
5. Implement data transfer encryption between server & client
6. Implement functionality for different types of attacks (for expanded useability)
7. Restructure code for both client & server to be more organized
