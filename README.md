### Finished Stuff
1. Sockets - Data is successfully transfered between Server & Client(s). (this has been tested and confirmed between two computers on the same network)
2. Logger - Desired information is logged. (Sent to user, console, and log.txt)
3. Threadding - Threadding is utilized throughout both the client and server for optimal performance.
4. UI implementation - MetroFrameworkUI is used to skin the application so it looks more appealing (.dll files for framework are included)
5. Client Handeling - Clients can be individually modified (currently in the form of right-clicking the client in the list)

### ToDo
1. Test different attack types to make sure they are effective
2. Improve error handling
3. Implement data encryption between server & client
